# Elliptec Example

These examples shows how you can control a Thorlabs Elliptec ELL6(/M), ELL18(/M) and ELL17(/M) in Python. The example for the dual position slider ELL6 also works for the sliders ELL9 and ELL12.The example for the linear stage ELL17(/M) is also valid for the larger linear stage ELL20(/M). The ELL18 example can also be applied to the ELL14, all of which use the PythonNet library. This library needs to be installed separately on the computer using pip.

The slider ELL6 is homed and changes position forwards and backwards.

The linear stage ELL17 is homed and performs an absolute and a relative move.

The slider ELL6 is homed and changes position forwards and backwards.
